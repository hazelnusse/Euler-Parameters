Example of how Euler parameters are used for parameterizing orientation, along
with outputting during numerical integration the 4x4 transformation ModelView
matrix that can be used directly by OpenGL.

Note that no issues arise when passing through the configurations that would
typically create numerical instabilities when parameterizing orientations using
Euler angles.
